This repo contains Differentially Private Resource Allocators (DPRAs) of different mechanisms.
Theoretical utility comparison and tradeoff (between privacy and utility) can be reimpletmented by running the .py files named theo_utility_comparison and theo_tradeoff.py.
simulation_lib.py includes defnitions for simulation of different mechnisms, including 
- uniform mechanism (uni.py), 
- one-sided geometric mechanism (geo1.py)
- double geometric mechanism (geo2.py)
- DPRA proposed by Angel et al. (akr.py)

The code in this repo are able to reimplement the results in our paper.

We hope this repo help you have a better understanding of DPRA.
