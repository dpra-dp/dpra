This repo contains Differentially Private Resource Allocators (DPRAs) of different mechanism.
Theoretical utility comparison and tradeoff (between privacy and utility) can be reimpletmented by running the .py files named xxx and xxx.
simulation_lib.py includes defnitions for simulation of different mechnisms, including 
- uniform mechanism (uni.py), 
- one-sided geometric mechanism (geo1.py)
- double geometric mechanism (geo2.py)
- DPRA proposed by Angel et al. (akr.py)

We hope this repo help you have a better understanding of DPRA.
